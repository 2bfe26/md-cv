### About

I got introduced to programming when I entered college, and I fell in love with this world. Since then, I've put in a lot of effort to improve my technical skills. I work as a full-stack developer, but I have an interest in all areas, from DevOps, frontend, and backend, to even compilers, operating systems, and computer graphics.

My satisfaction lies in solving problems and delivering high-quality code.

My hobbies include `playing chess`, `reading web novels` and ofcourse `programming`.

My first experience as a Senior in a team has been incredibly valuable. I've been learning a lot about team management, effective Scrum practices, task prioritization, and the importance of crafting clear documentation. Furthermore, it stands out as the experience that has added the most to my knowledge thus far, particularly in understanding and utilizing microservices. It has also ignited a growing desire within me to delve deeper into system design and architecture, further enhancing my expertise in this field.
