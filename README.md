### About

I got introduced to programming when I entered college, and I fell in love with this world. Since then, I've put in a lot of effort to improve my technical skills. I work as a full-stack developer, but I have an interest in all areas, from **DevOps**, **frontend**, and **backend**, to even **compilers**, **operating systems**, and **computer graphics**.

My satisfaction lies in solving problems and delivering high-quality code.

My hobbies include _playing chess_, _reading web novels_ and of course _programming_.

When I joined Objective, I was assigned to the DevOps team, and at Objective, I learned a lot about software quality. Software quality is more than well-structured and readable code; it's also about having sufficient tests to ensure the application's functionality, as well as monitoring and scalability.

I had my first experience with Kubernetes and managed a cluster using various resources. I delved into Docker and Shell scripting, where I collaborated with various teams to create automations. I wrote several pipelines in different technologies, including Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Bitbucket Pipelines.

I worked on international projects and gave presentations in English on testing to various teams.

Upon joining Ema, I actively contributed to the continuous development of the portal (Dox). During this period, I focused on enhancing this web application (React). Over the course of several months, I conducted a codebase restructuring, transforming it into a monorepo, where each system module became an independent package. Additionally, I successfully isolated the legacy portion and implemented a pipeline with unit testing and linting to ensure the overall application's quality.
Lastly, I introduced numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements to the application.

During my time as a researcher and developer at Rexlab, I had the opportunity to take my first steps in the web development realm. I collaborated with a team in building and maintaining a fullstack Laravel application aimed at promoting inclusive education through physics experiments (Relle).
During this period, I was tasked with integrating a Node.js application for experiment access control. This integration involved implementing an in-memory queue system with the ability to prioritize users who had scheduled experiments.
