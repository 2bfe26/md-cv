During my time at Objective, I joined the DevOps team and gained significant insights into **software quality**. Beyond clean and readable code, it encompasses **comprehensive testing**, application functionality assurance, **scalability** and **monitoring**. I ventured into Kubernetes, managing clusters and resources, while also exploring Docker and Shell scripting. Collaborating with **cross-functional teams**, I developed automation solutions and **created pipelines** using diverse technologies like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Bitbucket Pipelines. I contributed to **international projects** and delivered English presentations on testing to various teams.

In this past career phase, I reengaged with Ema, tasked with creating a secure and efficient product prototype. Its goal was to centralize data from various companies through an API, enabling notifications and dynamic charts. I also designed apps for data consumption and resource registration within this API. This experience significantly enriched my knowledge in **AWS**, handling **sensitive data**, and ensuring **high-performance**, **highly available API maintenance**.
