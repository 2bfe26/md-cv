My first experience as a Senior in a team has been incredibly valuable. I've been learning a lot about team management, effective Scrum practices, task prioritization, and the importance of crafting clear documentation. Furthermore, it stands out as the experience that has added the most to my knowledge thus far, particularly in understanding and utilizing microservices. It has also ignited a growing desire within me to delve deeper into system design and architecture, further enhancing my expertise in this field.
